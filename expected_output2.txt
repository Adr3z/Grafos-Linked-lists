The graph's adjacency list is:
------------------------------
A B D
B A C D
C B D
D A B C

The vertex D has degree = 3

The vertex C has degree = 2

Adding edge between the vertices A and C

The vertex C has degree = 3

Removing edge between the vertices A and D

Removing edge between the vertices D and C

The DFS from vertex with id = A is: {A B C D }

The BFS from vertex with id = D is: {D B A C }

The graph's adjacency list is:
------------------------------
A B C
B A C D
C B A
D B

Removing vertex with id = D

Adding vertex with id = E

The graph's adjacency list is:
------------------------------
A B C
B A C
C B A
E
